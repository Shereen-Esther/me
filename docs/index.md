I am Shereen Jubal, a dedicated Software Engineer with over three years of experience in web development, specializing in Angular, HTML, CSS3, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL), and NoSQL databases like Firebase and MongoDB. I have a proven track record of leading and mentoring teams, achieving project milestones with high-quality results. My strong problem-solving skills, innovative mindset, and attention to detail ensure effective project execution.

Programming has always fascinated me, and I chose it as a career because I love solving problems. Despite challenges and a lack of luck, I firmly believe in hard work and continuously push myself beyond my comfort zone. I'm passionate about coding and eager to learn new languages and technologies.

Beyond my professional life, I am an extrovert who loves interacting with new people. Outdoor activities and seeking adventure are vibrant threads in the tapestry of my life, driving me to explore new domains. I live by the quote, "In a world where we can be anything, be kind," and strive to uphold this value in my daily interactions.

My journey has been shaped by God's guidance, a supportive family, and great friends. Life has taught me many lessons, both academically and personally, and I am eager to continue growing and evolving in my career. I aspire to explore new domains and make meaningful contributions to the field of software engineering.
